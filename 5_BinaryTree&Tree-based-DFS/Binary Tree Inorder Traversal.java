/**
 * Description
Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Have you met this question in a real interview?  
Example
Given binary tree {1,#,2,3},

   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
 

return [1,3,2].

Challenge
Can you do it without recursion?

 * Trick: in Inorder, we care the right node least. So we keep going with left and curr;
 * only when there is a right node, we add it;
 * even after this, we go deep into that right node's left children all the way down.

/**
 * Approach 3: Morris Traversal
 * There is a clever way to perform an in-order traversal using only linear time and constant space,
 * first described by J. H. Morris in his 1979 paper "Traversing Binary Trees Simply and Cheaply".
 * In this method, we have to use a new data structure-Threaded Binary Tree, and the strategy is as follows:
 *  Step 1: Initialize current as root
 *  Step 2: While current is not NULL,
 *  If current does not have left child
 *      a. Add current's value
 *      b. Go to the right, i.e., current = current.right
 *  Else
 *      a. In current's left subtree, make current the right child of the rightmost node
 *      b. Go to this left child, i.e., current = current.left
 * 
 * Complexity Analysis
 * Time complexity : O(n).
 *  To prove that the time complexity is O(n),
 *  the biggest problem lies in finding the time complexity of finding the predecessor nodes of all the nodes in the binary tree.
 *  Intuitively, the complexity is O(nlogn), because to find the predecessor node for a single node related to the height of the tree.
 *  But in fact, finding the predecessor nodes for all nodes only needs O(n) time.
 *  Because a binary Tree with n nodes has nâˆ’1 edges, the whole processing for each edges up to 2 times,
 *  one is to locate a node, and the other is to find the predecessor node. So the complexity is O(n).
 * Space complexity : O(1)
