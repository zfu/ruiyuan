/**
 * Description
Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find k values in the BST that are closest to the target.

Given target value is a floating point.
You may assume k is always valid, that is: k â‰¤ total nodes.
You are guaranteed to have only one unique set of k values in the BST that are closest to the target.
Have you met this question in a real interview?  
Example
Given root = {1}, target = 0.000000, k = 1, return [1].

Challenge
Assume that the BST is balanced, could you solve it in less than O(n) runtime (where n = total nodes)?
