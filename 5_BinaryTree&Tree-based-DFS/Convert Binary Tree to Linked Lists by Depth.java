/**
 * 242. Convert Binary Tree to Linked Lists by Depth
Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth (e.g., if you have a tree with depth D, you'll have D linked lists).

Example
Given binary tree:

    1
   / \
  2   3
 /
4
return

[
  1->null,
  2->3->null,
  4->null
]
