/*
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Examples:
Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

/**
 * Approach 2: Sliding Window (Optimized)
 * The above solution requires at most 2n steps.
 * In fact, it could be optimized to require only n steps.
 * We could define a mapping of the characters to its index.
 * Then we can skip the characters immediately when we found a repeated character.
 *
 * The reason is that if s[j] have a duplicate in the range [i, j)with index j',
 * we don't need to increase i little by little. We can skip all the elements in the range [i, j']
 * and let i to be j' + 1 directly.
 *
 * Complexity Analysis
 * Time complexity : O(n). Index j will iterate n times.
 * Space complexity : O(min(m, n)). Same as the previous approach.
