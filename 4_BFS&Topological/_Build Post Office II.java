/**
 * 573. Build Post Office II
Given a 2D grid, each cell is either a wall 2, an house 1 or empty 0 (the number zero, one, two), 
find a place to build a post office so that the sum of the distance from the post office to all the houses is smallest.

Return the smallest sum of distance. Return -1 if it is not possible.

Example
Given a grid:

0 1 0 0 0
1 0 0 2 1
0 1 0 0 0
return 8, You can build at (1,1). (Placing a post office at (1,1), the distance that post office to all the house sum is smallest.)

Challenge
Solve this problem within O(n^3) time.

Notice
You cannot pass through wall and house, but can pass through empty.
You only build post office on an empty.
