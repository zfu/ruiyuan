/**
 * 894. Pancake Sorting Given an an unsorted array, sort the given array. You
 * are allowed to do only following operation on array.
 * 
 * flip(arr, i): Reverse array from 0 to i Unlike a traditional sorting
 * algorithm, which attempts to sort with the fewest comparisons possible, the
 * goal is to sort the sequence in as few reversals as possible.
 * 
 * Example Given array = [6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 20, 23] Use flip(arr, i) function to
 * sort the array.
 * 
 * Notice You only call flip function. Don't allow to use any sort function or
 * other sort methods.
 * 
 * Java：you can call FlipTool.flip(arr, i) C++： you can call FlipTool::flip(arr,
 * i) Python2&3 you can call FlipTool.flip(arr, i)
