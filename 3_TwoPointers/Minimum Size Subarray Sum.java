/*
Description
Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s,
find the minimal length of a subarray of which the sum ≥ s.
If there isn't one, return -1 instead.
Example
Given the array [2,3,1,2,4,3] and s = 7, the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
Challenge
If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is O(n log n).

/**
 * Approach: Two Pointers (Sliding Window)
 * This question is about Sliding Window, You can learn something about it here:
 * Sliding Window Template:
 * https://github.com/cherryljr/LeetCode/blob/master/Sliding%20Window%20Template.java
 * Of course, this question could be solved by more concise code, so we don't need to use the template.
 * But the main idea is the same.
 *
 * Algorithm
 * Initialize left pointer to 0 and sum to 0
 * Iterate over the nums:
 *  Add nums[right] to sum
 *  While sum is greater than or equal to s:
 *      1. Update rst=min(rst,right−left+1), where right−left+1 is the size of current subarray
 *      2. It means that the first index can safely be incremented,
 *      since, the minimum subarray starting with this index with sum≥s has been achieved
 *      3. nums[left] from sum and increment left
 *
 * Complexity analysis
 *  Time complexity: O(n). Single iteration of O(n).
 *  Each element can be visited at most twice, once by the right pointer(i) and (at most)once by the left pointer.
 *  Space complexity: O(1) extra space.
 *  Only constant space required for left, right, sum and rst.
