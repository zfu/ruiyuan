Description
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). 
n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). 
Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Notice
You may not slant the container.
Example
Given [1,3,2], the max area of the container is 2.

/**
 * Approach: Two Pointers
 * Algorithm:
 * The intuition behind this approach is that the area formed between the lines will always be limited by the height of the shorter line.
 * Further, the farther the lines, the more will be the area obtained.
 * We take two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the array constituting the length of the lines.
 * Futher, we maintain a variable maxarea to store the maximum area obtained till now.
 * At every step, we find out the area formed between them, 
 * update maxarea and move the pointer pointing to the shorter line towards the other end by one step.
 *
 * How this approach works?
 * Initially we consider the area constituting the exterior most lines.
 * Now, to maximize the area, we need to consider the area between the lines of larger lengths.
 * If we try to move the pointer at the longer line inwards, we won't gain any increase in area, since it is limited by the shorter line.
 * But moving the shorter line's pointer could turn out to be beneficial, as per the same argument, despite the reduction in the width.
 * This is done since a relatively longer line obtained by moving the shorter line's pointer might overcome the reduction in area caused by the width reduction.
 *
 * Complexity Analysis
 *  Time  complexity : O(n). Single pass.
 *  Space complexity : O(1). Constant space is used.
